## Quick Reference

### 1. Accessibility (CRITICAL)
- `color-contrast` - Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text (large text 3:1); Material Design
- `focus-states` - Visible focus rings on interactive elements (2–4px; Apple HIG, MD)
- `alt-text` - Descriptive alt text for meaningful images
- `aria-labels` - aria-label for icon-only buttons; accessibilityLabel in native (Apple HIG)
- `icon-context` - Semantics depend on use: decorative icons beside visible text are hidden from the accessibility tree; meaningful icons need a text alternative; icon controls need an accessible name and applicable state
- `keyboard-nav` - Tab order matches visual order; full keyboard support (Apple HIG)
- `form-labels` - Use label with for attribute
- `skip-links` - Skip to main content for keyboard users
- `heading-hierarchy` - Sequential h1→h6, no level skip
- `color-not-only` - Don't convey info by color alone (add icon/text)
- `dynamic-type` - Support system text scaling; avoid truncation as text grows (Apple Dynamic Type, MD)
- `reduced-motion` - Respect prefers-reduced-motion; reduce/disable animations when requested (Apple Reduced Motion API, MD)
- `voiceover-sr` - Meaningful accessibilityLabel/accessibilityHint; logical reading order for VoiceOver/screen readers (Apple HIG, MD)
- `escape-routes` - Provide cancel/back in modals and multi-step flows (Apple HIG)
- `keyboard-shortcuts` - Preserve system and a11y shortcuts; offer keyboard alternatives for drag-and-drop (Apple HIG)
- `focus-not-obscured` - Sticky UI, overlays, and banners must not hide the keyboard-focused control (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- `focus-not-obscured-enhanced` - Keep the entire focused component visible (WCAG 2.2 AAA)
- `focus-appearance` - Verify focus indicator area and 3:1 state contrast; visible focus alone is not enough (WCAG 2.2 AAA)
- `dragging-alternative` - Every author-controlled drag action needs a single-pointer and keyboard alternative (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- `web-target-size` - Web pointer targets need 24×24 CSS px or a documented exception; do not substitute native units (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- `consistent-help` - Repeated help mechanisms stay in the same relative order across a page set (WCAG 2.2 A)
- `redundant-entry` - Reuse information already supplied in the same process unless re-entry is essential (WCAG 2.2 A)
- `accessible-authentication` - Allow password managers and paste; provide a non-cognitive authentication path (WCAG 2.2 Minimum, AA).
- `auto-rotation-controls` - Carousels and moving content need pause/stop controls and must stop on focus or reduced motion (WAI)
- `contextual-live-badge-updates` - Announce a changed count/status as a complete contextual phrase without moving focus; use one appropriate live/status region and atomic updates only when needed

### 2. Touch & Interaction (CRITICAL)
- `touch-target-size` - Min 44×44pt (Apple) / 48×48dp (Material); extend hit area beyond visual bounds if needed
- `touch-spacing` - Minimum 8px/8dp gap between touch targets (Apple HIG, MD)
- `hover-vs-tap` - Use click/tap for primary interactions; don't rely on hover alone
- `loading-buttons` - Disable button during async operations; show spinner or progress
- `error-feedback` - Clear error messages near problem
- `cursor-pointer` - Add cursor-pointer to clickable elements (Web)
- `gesture-conflicts` - Avoid horizontal swipe on main content; prefer vertical scroll
- `tap-delay` - Use touch-action: manipulation to reduce 300ms delay (Web)
- `standard-gestures` - Use platform standard gestures consistently; don't redefine (e.g. swipe-back, pinch-zoom) (Apple HIG)
- `system-gestures` - Don't block system gestures (Control Center, back swipe, etc.) (Apple HIG)
- `press-feedback` - Visual feedback on press (ripple/highlight; MD state layers)
- `haptic-feedback` - Use haptic for confirmations and important actions; avoid overuse (Apple HIG)
- `gesture-alternative` - Don't rely on gesture-only interactions; always provide visible controls for critical actions
- `safe-area-awareness` - Keep primary touch targets away from notch, Dynamic Island, gesture bar and screen edges
- `no-precision-required` - Avoid requiring pixel-perfect taps on small icons or thin edges
- `swipe-clarity` - Swipe actions must show clear affordance or hint (chevron, label, tutorial)
- `drag-threshold` - Use a movement threshold before starting drag to avoid accidental drags

### 3. Performance (HIGH)
- `image-optimization` - Use WebP/AVIF, responsive images (srcset/sizes), lazy load non-critical assets
- `image-dimension` - Declare width/height or use aspect-ratio to prevent layout shift (Core Web Vitals: CLS)
- `font-loading` - Use font-display: swap/optional to avoid invisible text (FOIT); reserve space to reduce layout shift (MD)
- `font-preload` - Preload only critical fonts; avoid overusing preload on every variant
- `critical-css` - Prioritize above-the-fold CSS (inline critical CSS or early-loaded stylesheet)
- `lazy-loading` - Lazy load non-hero components via dynamic import / route-level splitting
- `bundle-splitting` - Split code by route/feature (React Suspense / Next.js dynamic) to reduce initial load and TTI
- `third-party-scripts` - Load third-party scripts async/defer; audit and remove unnecessary ones (MD)
- `reduce-reflows` - Avoid frequent layout reads/writes; batch DOM reads then writes
- `content-jumping` - Reserve space for async content to avoid layout jumps (Core Web Vitals: CLS)
- `lazy-load-below-fold` - Use loading="lazy" for below-the-fold images and heavy media
- `virtualize-lists` - Virtualize lists with 50+ items to improve memory efficiency and scroll performance
- `main-thread-budget` - Keep per-frame work under ~16ms for 60fps; move heavy tasks off main thread (HIG, MD)
- `progressive-loading` - Use skeleton screens / shimmer instead of long blocking spinners for >1s operations (Apple HIG)
- `input-latency` - Keep input latency under ~100ms for taps/scrolls (Material responsiveness standard)
- `tap-feedback-speed` - Provide visual feedback within 100ms of tap (Apple HIG)
- `debounce-throttle` - Use debounce/throttle for high-frequency events (scroll, resize, input)
- `offline-support` - Provide offline state messaging and basic fallback (PWA / mobile)
- `network-fallback` - Offer degraded modes for slow networks (lower-res images, fewer animations)

### 4. Style Selection (HIGH)
- `style-match` - Match style to product type
- `consistency` - Use same style across all pages
- `no-emoji-icons` - Use SVG icons (Heroicons, Lucide), not emojis
- `color-palette-from-product` - Choose palette from product/industry (Barzzo: #B45A2B copper brand, 4 surface layers, black/white single text tone)
- `effects-match-style` - Shadows, blur, radius aligned with chosen style
- `platform-adaptive` - Respect platform idioms: navigation, controls, typography, motion
- `state-clarity` - Make hover/pressed/disabled states visually distinct while staying on-style
- `elevation-consistent` - Use a consistent elevation/shadow scale for cards, sheets, modals
- `dark-mode-pairing` - Design light/dark variants together to keep brand, contrast, and style consistent
- `icon-style-consistent` - Use one icon set/visual language across the product
- `primary-action` - Each screen should have only one primary CTA; secondary actions visually subordinate

### 5. Layout & Responsive (HIGH)
- `viewport-meta` - width=device-width initial-scale=1 (never disable zoom)
- `mobile-first` - Design mobile-first, then scale up to tablet and desktop
- `breakpoint-consistency` - Use systematic breakpoints (e.g. 375 / 768 / 1024 / 1440)
- `readable-font-size` - Minimum 16px body text on mobile (avoids iOS auto-zoom)
- `line-length-control` - Mobile 35–60 chars per line; desktop 60–75 chars
- `horizontal-scroll` - No horizontal scroll on mobile; ensure content fits viewport width
- `spacing-scale` - Use 4pt/8dp incremental spacing system
- `touch-density` - Keep component spacing comfortable for touch
- `container-width` - Consistent max-width on desktop
- `fixed-element-offset` - Fixed navbar/bottom bar must reserve safe padding for underlying content
- `viewport-units` - Prefer min-h-dvh over 100vh on mobile
- `visual-hierarchy` - Establish hierarchy via size, spacing, contrast — not color alone

### 6. Typography & Color (MEDIUM)
- Base 16px body text, line-height 1.5.

- Single text base color: #000000 on light, #FFFFFF on dark.

### 7. Forms & Feedback (MEDIUM)
- Visible labels, helper text, inline field validation near field.
- Loading, empty, error, and success states for all flows.
